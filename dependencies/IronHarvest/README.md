You have reached the **benchmarks** repository of the [Shortest Path Lab](https://pathfinding.ai).
Here we make available community-generated benchmarks for evaluating pathfinding algorithms.

The benchmarks comprise **map** files and **scenario** files. A map file is
a description of the operating environment of the pathfinding agent. These can
can be in one of several standard formats such as square grid, navigation mesh
and polygon obstacle descriptions. A [scenario]() file is collection of location
pairs which must be solved by finding a shortest path, from start to target
on the associated map.

In this repository: 

| Path | Description |
| :--- | :---------- |
| ├ [grid-maps](https://bitbucket.org/shortestpathlab/benchmarks/src/master/grid-maps/) | Collections of square grids with uniform costs.  |
| ├ [mesh-maps]() | Collections of navigation meshes with uniform costs. |
| └ [poly-maps]() | Collections of polygonal obstacles in the plane. |
| └ [road-maps]() | Collections of road network graphs. |
